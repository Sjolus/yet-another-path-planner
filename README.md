## Architecture & Monorepo Plan

The high-level component plan—including the proposed monorepo layout, technology choices, CI/CD flow, and Kubernetes deployment strategy—is documented in `docs/architecture.md`. Start there when evaluating how the frontend, backend, infrastructure, and operational tooling fit together. Detailed local setup instructions are tracked in `docs/onboarding.md`, and automation/AI agent guidelines live in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
