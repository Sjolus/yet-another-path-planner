# Shared Packages

This directory contains shared libraries used across the monorepo.

## Future Packages

Packages to be added as needed:

- `@yapp/types` - Shared TypeScript types and interfaces
- `@yapp/sdk` - Client SDK generated from OpenAPI specs
- `@yapp/design-tokens` - Design system tokens and utilities
- `@yapp/config` - Shared configuration utilities
- `@yapp/telemetry` - OpenTelemetry instrumentation helpers

Each package should follow the monorepo structure and be importable by frontend, backend, and other packages.
